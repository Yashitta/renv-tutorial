```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Flipper Length vs. Body Mass",
       x = "Flipper Length (mm)",
       y = "Body Mass (g)")
```

As shown in @fig-penguin-plot, the relationship between flipper length and body mass varies by species.
